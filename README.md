# Java-Web-App
Dynamic java web application that allows users to create an account and log in to the website. This web application utilizes Java Servlets, JSP pages, Java classes,
and some CSS/Bootstrap styling. 
There is a lot more I can do to make this web application better, and so far I've learned a great amount about how dynamic web applications are structured.

The reason that I created this web application was to get a grasp on using basic OOP within web applications.
- I was also able to practice developing clean code - having separate packages for Login and Register and utilizing a MVC structured program.

I had the chance to go in depth and add other features to the application, such as a budget tracker, but I felt I took away what I needed from this small project, 
and I wanted to move on to other languages such as Python, PHP, etc.
